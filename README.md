Property is a system of rights that gives people legal control of valuable things, and also refers to the valuable things themselves.
An investment property analysis is how real estate investors summarize the performance of their rental properties. Typically, an analysis will look at an investor's current holdings from their rental investments along with ratios of income and expenses.
